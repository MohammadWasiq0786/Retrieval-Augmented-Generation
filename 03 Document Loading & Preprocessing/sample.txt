How to Contact Us
1. Accounts
You need an account for most activities on our platform. Keep your password somewhere safe because you're responsible for all activity associated with your account. If you suspect someone else is using your account, let us know by contacting our Support Team. You must have reached the age of consent for online services in your country to use Euron.

2. Communications
By creating an account on Euron, you grant us permission to contact you regarding important platform communications, updates, and relevant information about our services. While we may send you emails for these purposes, you maintain the right to unsubscribe from our email communications at any time through the unsubscribe option provided in our emails. However, please note that even if you opt out of marketing communications, you may still receive essential account-related and transaction notifications.

3. Content Enrollment and Access
When you enroll in a course or other content, you get a license from us to view it via the Euron Services and no other use. Don't try to transfer or resell content in any way.

4. Payments and Refunds
When you make a payment, you agree to use a valid payment method. We put a lot of effort to bring our content to the world, and we are one of the most affordable platforms for learning in the entire world. We do not provide any refund option for our users.

5. Digital Product Access & Shipping Policy
Upon successful payment through Razorpay, you will receive access to the purchased digital content or courses immediately. A confirmation email with access instructions will be sent to your registered email address. Please ensure you use the same email address for both login and purchase. Access to the content will last for the duration specified at the time of purchase, and may include downloadable resources. If you encounter any issues with access, please contact our support team.

Your payment information is securely processed through Razorpay, and we do not store your payment details.
